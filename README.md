# Satellite orbital dynamics modelization

Project Status: Completed (Academic Project)
Development Period: Apr 2024 - Jun 2024
Language: C

## Description

This is a standalone C implementation of a numerical solver that models the orbital motion of a satellite in a central gravitational field. The code integrates the equations of motion using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method and allows the analysis of orbital evolution, energy conservation, and dissipative effects.

## How to use

The code is contained in a single file for ease of use.
Compile with any standard C compiler:

$ gcc satellite.c -o satellite.x -lm
